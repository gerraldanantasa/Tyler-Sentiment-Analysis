even wanna fuck 'cause your presence was enough You and I make sense, you stayed back at my telly We was chattin' 'til mornin', the vibrations was heavy I wasn't drownin' or yawnin', that's when I told you my feelings You told me you felt the same, but you got homie you dealin' with Damn, I didn't know, that's a bit unexpected But I get it, it's whatever, least I can do is respect it We still gon' kick it and check-in like nothin' could ever stop it The problem is he my friend, but if I'm honest, I'm really hopin' you drop him It's morals I really have, it's lines I could never cross But you got somethin' that make all them good intentions get lost I try to keep it together, never felt this way We spent 'bout two weeks together, only skipped one day And they say, ""Bros over hoes,"" I'm like, ""Mm, nah, hey"" I would rather hold your hand than have a cool handshake But whatever, we still could be friends, it could still be chance I'ma play it cool, we got somethin', we cannot pretend, uh, uh It's, it's like starting a race And then when you take off, they like, ""No, no, it's not a end,"" ha It was too late and shit FaceTimin', it ain't 'bout nothin', you laughin', packin' your luggage It's nothin' incriminatin', but please delete our discussions You hit me with the look and replied like, ""Duh, bitch"" Don't want your man to think that we creepin' behind his back Cross the line, cross the line, cross the— nah, we never did that Though I haven't seen him in months, shit is rare he never hit back Anyway, convince him to bring you to me so we could kick it Right in front of his lenses, nothing here is malicious You sat by me in that movie, we went outside for them doobies We walkin' off when we talk, man, that nigga not fuckin' stupid He see it, he know it's somethin' we frontin' like, ""Ha-ha-ha"" Whenever we ""Ha-ha-ha,"" we subtly press his buttons Not on purpose, but, man, I found my purpose If I fucked our friendship up for you, I think it's worth it But, nah, I can't do that, that nigga don't deserve it And plus y'all got depth, I'm just the nigga on the surface, for real Surface I said surface, like, 'cause they got roots Like, I'm the new nigga But you know, they be fuckin', haha Yeah, yeah Didn't see you a couple weeks, think he want you away from me Know y'all argued 'bout if you mad you met him before you met me I feel guilty, but not as much as I should I tried to have that self-control, but not as much as I could I been down for days, you in my city and I can't see your face I can't eat knowin' you with him and not at my place I
